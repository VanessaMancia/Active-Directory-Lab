## Integrated Active Directory Enviornment in VirtualBox 
---
### Introduction 
---
For this project, Oracle VirtualBox was utilized to create an integrated enviornment that consisted of a Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machine (VM) serving as the Domain Controller (DC) with Active Directory (AD) service. A custom PowerShell script was deployed to populate approximately 1,000 fake users. Windows 10 Pro VM was integrated into AD to create a centralized management system for user accounts, computers, and other network resources.
